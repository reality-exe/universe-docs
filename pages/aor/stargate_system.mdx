# Resonite Stargate System
The Resonite Stargate System is a set of specially designed devices allowing you to travel vast distances in a
[world](https://wiki.resonite.com/World) or seemlessly travel between [sessions](https://wiki.resonite.com/Session).

## Types of stargates
Our stargate system has multiple types of gates. 
[MilkyWay Stargate](#milkyway-stargate), [Pegasus Stargate](#pegasus-stargate), [Universe Stargate](#milkyway-stargate),
[Tolan Stargate](#tolan-stargate), and soon the [Dawn Stargate](#milkyway-stargate), 

### MilkyWay Stargate
The MilkyWay stargate is portrayed as it was in [Stargate: SG-1](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stargate_SG-1). 
You can distinguish this gate from others from the orange-red chevrons aswell as an inner glyph ring that can also spin.
They're usually place ontop of a ramp with a [Dial home Device](#dial-home-device).

### Pegasus Stargate
The Pegasus stargate is portrayed as it was in [Stargate: Atlantis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stargate_Atlantis).
You can distinguish this gate from others from the blue chevrons aswell as the static digital glyph ring.
They are mostly found slightly embedded into the ground with a [Dial home Device](#dial-home-device).

### Universe Stargate
The Universe stargate is portrayed as it was in [Stargate: Universe](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stargate_Universe).
You can distinguish this gate from others from the whole gate being black, it's white chevrons, aswell as the entire gate spinning when dialing.
They are always found on a ramp and without a [Dial home Device](#dial-home-device) as they are often dialed with with the [Kino Remote](#kino-remote).

### Tollan Stargate
The Tollan stargate is a unique stargate built by both the [Tollan](https://stargate.fandom.com/wiki/Tollan_(people)) and the [Nox](https://stargate.fandom.com/wiki/Nox).
This gate is distinguished by being white with blue chevrons, it does not have a glyph track and is a MilkyWay type gate.

### Orlin's Stargate
Orlin's stargate is a small MilkyWay type gate made of earth materials (Most notably a toaster).
The wormhole is unstable and risks the loss of travellers. This gate was also built by Orlin who was a descended ancient.

### Dawn Stargate
<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
    The Dawn Stargate is not finished therefor is not yet accessible. Keep an eye on the Discord server for further updates.
</Callout>
The Dawn stargate is a unique gate to Resonite. You can distinguish this gate very easily because of the chevrons that resemble the Resonite logo, the blue gradient on the outter ring,
aswell as the extremely unique event horizon. This gate also doesnt have an unstable vortex (Also known as the "Kawoosh").
These gates will mostly be found in "Dawn" style worlds such as the default cloud home world.

## Dialing Devices
### Dial Home Device
The Dial Home Device (Also known as the DHD) is a large circular pedastal with 36-38 buttons placed around a large center button.
The glyphs on the buttons correspond to the gate type the DHD is bound with. You can also optionally enable a text overlay to make it easier to dial.

### SGC Computer
The Stargate Command (SGC) computer is Earth's way of dialing the gate. It also has extra information on other screens such as an "address book" that shows all active stargates, energy output,
IDC monitoring, and a camera that shows the top chevron.

### Ancient Remote
The Ancient Remote is a handheld device primarily used to dial Universe type stargates however they can work with anything.
They wirelessly link to a nearby gate and will list any other stargates in the same session. The remote cannot dial 8 or 9 chevron addresses therefor being locked to gates of the same type.

The remote can also display information about the linked gate and its current dial state.

It can also link to the Destiny starship when either in a user-hosted world or the dedicated headless session to display the FTL timer.

### Destiny Console
The Destiny console is functionally similar to the SGC computer. It has an address input and will show info about the connected stargate.
