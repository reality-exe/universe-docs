# Stargate Setup
Learn how to setup a stargate in-session or cross-session

## Local In-Session Setup
### Requirements
- Any type of [stargate](/aor/stargate_system#types-of-stargates).
- A DHD of the same type
    - _With the MilkyWay gate type you can use either the normal DHD or the SGC computer_
- Enough room for the stargate (It's pretty big)
- And optionally a ramp of your choosing.

### Setup
1. Place the gate and the DHD in the location you want.
    - When using a ramp the stargate will snap into place.
2. Use the grabbable setter tool to make the stargate and related objects not grabbable.
3. Find the setup dialog on the stargate and the DHD.
4. Grab the slot reference from the DHD setup dialog and place it into the DHD input on the gate setup dialog.
5. Input a valid stargate address.
    - Must be six unique characters and not taken by another stargate.
6. (MilkyWay Stargate Only) Optionally select your Point of Origin.
7. Press the button at the bottom of the setup dialog.

## Cross-Session Setup
<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
    The cross-session function of the stargates is meant for headless sessions.
    **If the gate is on a user-hosted session and the host focuses to another world the gate will cease to function.**
</Callout>
<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
    You must allow the websocket URL (`wss://gates.rxserver.net/`).
    If the session is on a headless client add the URL to the "allowedUrlHosts" array in the headless config.
    If you do not own the headless contact the owner and ask (Kindly) to add the URL and restart the session.
</Callout>

- A DHD of the same type
    - _With the MilkyWay gate type you can use either the normal DHD or the SGC computer_

- **Session must be set to "Anyone" or "Registered Users"

### Setup
This setup method is a one time thing and will have to be redone everytime the world starts.

1. Place the gate and the DHD in the location you want.
    - When using a ramp the stargate will snap into place.
2. Use the grabbable setter tool to make the stargate and related objects not grabbable.
3. Find the setup dialog on the stargate and the DHD.
4. Grab the slot reference from the DHD setup dialog and place it into the DHD input on the gate setup dialog.
5. Input a valid stargate address.
    - Must be six unique characters and not taken by another stargate.
    - If the stargate address is already taken by another cross-session stargate the setup dialog will show itself again.
6. (MilkyWay Stargate Only) Optionally select your Point of Origin.
7. Enable the cross-session checkbox.
9. Fill in the name of your choosing.
10. Press the button at the bottom of the setup dialog
    - You may also have to allow the websocket host.

### Auto-Setup
This setup method will setup the gate every time the world starts.

1. [Follow the first setup steps](#setup-1)
2. Spawn the Auto-Setup Script.
3. Place the same info you used for the gate setup into the auto-setup dialog.
4. Use a developer tooltip to grab the slot reference of the stargate and place into the "Primary Stargate" input of the auto-setup script.
5. Save the world.
6. Restart the world once synced.
7. Check to see if your gate is on [the public gate list](https://sgn.rxserver.net). If it isnt press the "Reconnect" button on the auto-setup script. If that still doesnt work DM or ping Detective, Virgil, or Climber in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/RtwD48gtGS) server.
