# Ancients of Resonite


## What is the Ancients of Resonite

The Ancients of Resonite is a group made by me (Realit.exe/DetectiveBot), Virgil, and Climber dedicated to making technology from the [Stargate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stargate) franchise.

## Main Project
Our main project is the [Cross-Session Stargate Network](/stargate_network). A system that allows you to dial from a stargate in one session to a stargate in a different one and seemlessly travel through.

## Team
- Reality.exe (AKA DetectiveBot)
- Virgil
- Climber
- Aegis_Wolf
